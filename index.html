                    <h4>Priority Items</h4>
                    <p>Priority Items are important campus messages that are crucial for operations or sharing updates
                        on significant University initiatives. Only a small number of designated offices have
                        permissions to send Priority Items, which have replaced most all-campus emails previously sent
                        by the Office of the President, Office of the Provost, Dean of the College, University Human
                        Resources, and other key academic and administrative units. </p>
                    <p>The Today@Brown subject line indicates when there are Priority Items in the email digest so
                        readers can easily spot important announcements in their inboxes. And Priority Items run at the
                        top of the email digest so they are always immediately viewable.</p>

                        </h5>
                        <p>User testing has shown that Today@Brown has higher open rates compared to all-community email
                            messages sent directly to inboxes. Additionally, the Today@Brown website receives over one
                            million pageviews annually.</p>
                        <p>And mass emails on campus have declined more than 90% since Today@Brown’s launch in 2017,
                            enabling faculty, staff and students to focus on their work and studies.</p>

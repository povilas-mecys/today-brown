                        In summer 2024, the Today@Brown team launched two important new features in direct response to input
                    from the campus community — rich text formatting and full integration with Events@Brown.

                        <h4>Rich Text Formatting</h4>
                        <p>When submitting announcements and events, you can now use rich text formatting, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Embedded links</li>
                            <li>Headings</li>
                            <li>Bulleted lists</li>
                            <li>Numbered lists</li>
                            <li>Bold text</li>
                            <li>Italicized text</li>
                        </ul>
                    </article>
                    <p>
                        Please continue to use simple text for the first sentence of your submission because Today@Brown
                    automatically uses the first 100 characters of that sentence as the descriptor for your submission
                    that appears in the email digest. In other words, avoid starting a message with a heading or a list.
                    </p>

                                With a new integration with the Events@Brown calendar, the process for promoting an event in Today@Brown has been significantly streamlined. To date, promoting an event in Today@Brown has required entering the event twice — once in Events@Brown and then again in Today@Brown.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, when creating or editing events in Events@Brown, you will simply use the checkbox for “Submit this event to Today@Brown” and enter the event information.

                            <p>
                                You will not need to create a separate item about your event in Today@Brown, nor will you be able to as in the past — instead, your event entry in Events@Brown will flow into Today@Brown.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                When creating or editing an event, you will have the option to designate second and third publication dates for your event to appear in Today@Brown.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                If you don’t have a login for Events@Brown, you can use <a href="https://events.brown.edu/submit">the general submission form</a> and indicate with the checkbox that it should be promoted in Today@Brown.
                            </p>

                                If your event is rejected by the Today@Brown moderator, you can go back to Events@Brown to make the edits and/or changes required by the moderator.

                        <h4>Announcement Submissions Unchanged</h4>
                        <p>
                            For announcements — not events, which are distinct — you will still submit items to Today@Brown as  you do currently. What’s the difference between an announcement and an event?
                        </p>
                    </header>
                    <div>

                            <p>
                                Per Today@Brown guidelines, an event has a specific location and a short-duration timeframe associated with it. For example, a performance to be held at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, July 9, at the Lindemann Performing Arts center is an event, because it takes place at a specific time.
                            </p>
                        </article>

                            <p>
                                An announcement is a notice about an initiative that may or may not be linked to a timeframe. For example, an all-day blood drive on the Campus Green is considered an announcement because it does not have a specific start and end time.
